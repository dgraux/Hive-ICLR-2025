HIVE Supplementary Material + MuSE Benchmark
============================================

> Associated with our ICLR'25 publication entitled "_From an LLM swarm
> to a PDDL-empowered HIVE: planning self-executed instructions in a
> multi-modal jungle_", we prepare an archive containing additional
> materials which may be useful.


File Hierarchy
--------------

This archive contains:

- `README.md` this file;
- `MuSE_Benchmark/` which provides the raw data for the MuSE benchmark
    we designed, composed of
   - `README.md`
   - `queries.json`
   - `data/audios/`
   - `data/images/`
- `C-KG_excerpt/` to visualise in a Web-browser the sub-graph of our
    Capability-KG corresponding to the experiments we present in the
    article so to tackle the MuSE benchmark.
   - `src/` containing various JavaScript data and library files
   - `capability_kg.html` the GUI to be opened
- `PDDL-domain-files/` corresponding to the 10 domains involved in the
    MuSE Benchmark
- `Screencast.mp4` which presents a complete run-through of a query
    for all the systems we tested in the submission, _i.e._,
    HuggingGPT, ControlLLM and **Hive**
- `Report.pdf` the associated report displayed in `Screencast.mp4`
